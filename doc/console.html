<h1>PageSpeed Console</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the Console</h2>
<p>
  The PageSpeed Console reports various problems your installation has that can
  lead to sub-optimal performance. The console graphs metrics for these
  problems over time so that you can see the result of your changes
  improving or degrading your performance. You can view it by enabling it and
  then visiting <code>/pagespeed_admin/console</code> from your server. The
  console works by saving snapshots of the statistics reported by
  PageSpeed and then using the Google Chart Tools API to graph those
  statistics over time.
<h2 id="configuring">Configuring the Console</h2>
<p>
  The PageSpeed Console is configured with several directives in the
  configuration file. See
  <a href="install#module">PageSpeed Installation and Configuration</a>
  for details about this file. Each of these directives is explained here.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code><a href="admin#statistics">Statistics</a></code>
    must be enabled to report statistics.</li>
  <li>
    <code>StatisticsLogging</code> must be enabled so that graphs of
    statistics over time can be drawn in the console.</li>
  <li>
    <code>LogDir</code> must be set so that we have a directory to store
    statistic logs.</li>
  <li>
    In order to access the console, you must set a handler appropriately.
    For example, to make the console only accessible from localhost:
    <dl>
      <dt>Apache:<dd><pre>
ModPagespeedStatistics on
ModPagespeedStatisticsLogging on
ModPagespeedLogDir /var/log/pagespeed
&lt;Location /pagespeed_admin&gt;
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from localhost
  Allow from 127.0.0.1
  SetHandler pagespeed_admin
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
      <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre>
pagespeed Statistics on;
pagespeed StatisticsLogging on;
pagespeed LogDir /var/log/pagespeed;
pagespeed AdminPath /pagespeed_admin;

location ~ ^/pagespeed_admin {
  allow 127.0.0.1;
  deny all;
}</pre>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally these optional parameters may be configured:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>StatisticsLoggingIntervalMs</code> may be set to indicate how often
    to log statistics snapshots (in milliseconds).</li>
  <li>
    <code>StatisticsLoggingMaxFileSizeKb</code> may be set to indicate the
    maximum size for the logfile (in kilobytes).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For example, to log once a minute with a maximum log size of 1 MB:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre>
ModPagespeedStatisticsLoggingIntervalMs 60000
ModPagespeedStatisticsLoggingMaxFileSizeKb 1024</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre>
pagespeed StatisticsLoggingIntervalMs 60000;
pagespeed StatisticsLoggingMaxFileSizeKb 1024;</pre>
</dl>

<h2 id="access">Accessing the Console</h2>
<p>
  The console can be accessed by browsing to
  <code>http://your.example.com/pagespeed_admin/console</code>. Access to
  this page can be controlled using standard access directives.
</p>
<p>
  Note that if you would like to access the console from machines other
  than your server, you will need to allow access to
  <code>/pagespeed_admin</code>.
</p>

<!-- TODO(sligocki): Add section for features, like zooming in, etc. once we
     add them. -->

<h2 id="graphs">Graphed metrics</h2>
The PageSpeed console displays graphs for these metrics:
<ul>
  <li id="fetch-failure">
    <b>Resources not loaded because of fetch failures</b>:
    Images, CSS or JavaScript could not be loaded because backend HTTP fetch
    failed. <b>Remedy</b>: You may have to reconfigure your server to allow
    outgoing connections or to have access to DNS.</li>

  <li id="not-authorized">
    <b>Resources not rewritten because domain wasn't authorized</b>:
    Resources could not be rewritten because they were on a different domain
    than the HTML and that domain was not explicitly authorized.
    <b>Remedy</b>: Add <a href="domains#auth_domains">Domain</a>
    authorizations for all domains you control.</li>

  <li id="cache-control">
    <b>Resources not rewritten because of restrictive Cache-Control headers</b>:
    Resources could not be rewritten because they had restrictive Cache-Control
    headers explicitly set (for example: <code>Cache-Control: private</code>,
    <code>Cache-Control: max-age=0</code> or
    <code>Cache-Control: no-transform</code>).
    <b>Remedy</b>: Reconfigure your server to serve these resources with
    public caching headers (or no Cache-Control headers at all). For example,
    <code>Header set Cache-Control "max-age=600"</code> in Apache config.</li>

  <li id="cache-miss">
    <b>Cache misses</b>:
    Resources were not rewritten because they were not found in cache.
    This is expected while your cache warms up, soon after you install, however
    if it continues to be high, your cache is probably too small.
    <b>Remedy</b>: Increase the
    <a href="system#file_cache">FileCacheSizeKb</a> to be about 5 times
    as large as your website content (to store all of the original
    resources and various versions of rewritten resources).</li>

  <li id="cache-expired">
    <b>Cache lookups that were expired</b>:
    Although these resources were found in cache, they were not rewritten
    because they were older than their max-age.
    <b>Remedy</b>: (A) Enable
    <a href="domains#ModPagespeedLoadFromFile">LoadFromFile</a> to tell
    the server to load the files straight from disk rather than through
    HTTP. (B) Reconfigure your server to serve resources with longer TTL.
    For example, <code>Header set Cache-Control "max-age=3600"</code> to set
    one hour TTL in Apache config.</li>

  <li id="css-error">
    <b>CSS files not rewritten because of parse errors</b>:
    CSS files could not be rewritten because our parser found syntax errors
    that it could not recover from. <b>Remedy</b>: Fix CSS files to use
    proper syntax. You can use the stand-alone
    <a href="build_mod_pagespeed_from_source#debug-css">css_minify_main</a>
    to find what part of the CSS file has parse errors. We have had some
    problems in the past with valid CSS3 or proprietary CSS extensions
    causing CSS parsing errors. If you find that your valid CSS is failing to
    parse, let us know on our <a href="mailing-lists#discussion">discussion
    group</a> so we can fix the parser.</li>

  <li id="js-error">
    <b>JavaScript minification failures</b>:
    JavaScript files could not be minified because our parser found some
    syntax problem that it could not recover from. This is very uncommon.
    <b>Remedy</b>: As with CSS, fix the JavaScript files that had problems.</li>

  <li id="image-error">
    <b>Image rewrite failures</b>:
    Image files were not rewritten for various reasons:<ul>
      <li><code>image_norewrites_high_resolution</code>: Image was too large.
        Currently we only rewrite images below 8 Megapixels.
        <b>Remedy</b>: Resize original images to a reasonable size.</li>
      <li><code>image_rewrites_dropped_decode_failure</code>: Image could not
        be parsed by our code. <b>Remedy</b>: Fix malformed images.</li>
      <li><code>image_rewrites_dropped_due_to_load</code>: Image was not
        rewritten because your system was already busy rewriting other images.
        This generally can happen when you first install PageSpeed
        while the cache warms up. <b>Remedy</b>: If image rewrites continue
        to be dropped after a day or so, you may need to
        <a href="#cache-miss">increase your cache size</a> or increase the
        <a href="reference-image-optimize#ImageMaxRewritesAtOnce">
          ImageMaxRewritesAtOnce</a>.</li>
      <li><code>image_rewrites_dropped_mime_type_unknown</code>: Image could
        not be rewritten because we do not recognize its MIME-type. For
        example, we do not parse <code>image/x-icon</code> or
        <code>image/svg+xml</code>. <b>Remedy</b>: Convert your images to a
        type that we understand (gif, png, jpg, webp) or perhaps just fix
        a broken server config that is serving images with a bogus
        <code>Content-Type</code> header.</li>
      <li><code>image_rewrites_dropped_server_write_fail</code>: Unexpected
        server error while rewriting images. If you get a significant number
        of these write to our <a href="mailing-lists#discussion">discussion
        group</a> so we can investigate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
