<h1>Security Considerations for PageSpeed</h1>


<p>
Any change to a website has the possibility of introducing new security holes.
Pagespeed is not an exception to this rule.  This document covers specific
security concerns to keep in mind when using PageSpeed.
</p>

<h2 id="untrusted_content">Untrusted Content</h2>
<p>
Any time you reference untrusted content on your website, you are at risk of
security attack.  This is most clear for JavaScript which will have access to
your domain's cookies because of the Same Origin Policy. It can also be true
for CSS, which can contain JavaScript references (ex. the IE behavior
property described in this
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-becss-19990804#behavior">W3C reference</a>
and at this <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/behavior">reference</a>
by SitePoint&reg;. Even images in certain situations can be used in attacks
(ex: <a href="http://hackaday.com/2008/08/04/the-gifar-image-vulnerability/">
GIFAR attack</a>).
</p>
<p class="caution">
<strong>Caution:</strong>
Do not reference untrusted content on your website. If you do store
user content or other untrusted content, keep it on a separate cookie-less
domain and do <strong>NOT</strong> tell PageSpeed to rewrite from that
domain to your main cookied domain.
</p>

<h2 id="private_content">Private Content</h2>
<p>
PageSpeed rewrites and, effectively, proxies resources referenced in
the main HTML document. It respects public caching headers, so if a resource
is not explicitly marked public cacheable, PageSpeed will not rewrite
nor re-serve it. However, PageSpeed will re-serve resources which
<strong>ARE</strong> publicly cacheable.
If you serve private content as publicly cacheable,
PageSpeed will proxy it to any who requests a specific URL. Note that any
public proxy in the Internet can do the same thing.
</p>
<p class="caution">
<strong>Caution:</strong>
Explicitly mark private content as not publicly cacheable.
