<h1>PageSpeed Authorizing and Mapping Domains</h1>
<h2 id="auth_domains">Authorizing domains</h2>
<p>
In addition to optimizing HTML resources, PageSpeed restricts itself to
optimizing resources (JavaScript, CSS, images) that are served from domains,
with optional paths, that must be explicitly listed in the configuration file.
For example:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedDomain http://example.com
ModPagespeedDomain cdn.example.com
ModPagespeedDomain http://styles.example.com/css
ModPagespeedDomain *.example.org</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed Domain http://example.com;
pagespeed Domain cdn.example.com;
pagespeed Domain http://styles.example.com/css;
pagespeed Domain *.example.org;</pre>
</dl>

<p>
PageSpeed will rewrite resources found from these explicitly
listed domains, although in the case of <code>styles.example.com</code>
only resources under the <code>css</code> directory will be rewritten.
Additionally, it will rewrite resources that are
served from the same domain as the HTML file, or are specified as
a path relative to the HTML.  When resources are rewritten, their
domain and path are not changed.  However, the leaf name is changed to
encode rewriting information that can be used to identify and serve
the optimized resource.
</p>

<p>The leading "http://" is optional; bare hostnames will be interpreted
as referring to HTTP. Wildcards can be used in the domain.</p>

<p>
These directives can be used
in <a href="configuration#htaccess">location-specific configuration
sections</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="mapping_origin">Mapping origin domains</h2>

<p>In order to improve the performance of web pages, PageSpeed
must examine and modify the content of resources referenced on those
pages.  To do that, it must fetch those resources using HTTP, using
the URL reference specified on the HTML page.</p>

<p>In some cases, the URL specified in the HTML file is not the best URL to use
to fetch the resource. Scenarios where this is a concern include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the server is behind a load balancer, and it's more efficient to
    reference the server directly by its IP address, or as 'localhost'.</li>
  <li>The server has a special DNS configuration</li>
  <li>The server is behind a firewall preventing outbound connections</li>
  <li>The server is running in a CDN or proxy, and must go back to the
    origin server for the resources</li>
  <li>The server needs to service https requests</li>
</ol>

<p>In these situations the remedy is to map the origin domain:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain origin_to_fetch_from origin_specified_in_html [host_header]</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed MapOriginDomain origin_to_fetch_from origin_specified_in_html [host_header];</pre>
</dl>

<p>Wildcards can also be used in the <code>origin_specified_in_html</code>, e.g.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain localhost *.example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed MapOriginDomain localhost *.example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>The <code>origin_to_fetch_from</code> can include a path after the domain
name, e.g.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain localhost/example *.example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed MapOriginDomain localhost/example *.example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>When a path is specified, the source domain is mapped to the destination
domain and the source path is mapped to the concatenation of the path from
<code>origin_to_fetch_from</code> and the source path. For example, given the
above mapping, <code>http://www.example.com/index.html</code> will be mapped
to <code>http://localhost/example/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>The origin_specified_in_html can specify https but the origin_to_fetch_from
can only specify http, e.g.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain http://localhost https://www.example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed MapOriginDomain http://localhost https://www.example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>This directive lets the server accept https requests for
<code>www.example.com</code> without requiring a SSL certificate to fetch
resources - in fact, this is the only way PageSpeed can service https requests
as currently it cannot use https to fetch resources. For example, given the
above mapping, and assuming the server is configured for https support,
PageSpeed will fetch and optimize resources accessed using
<code>https://www.example.com</code>, fetching the resources from
<code>http://localhost</code>, which can be the same server process or a
different server process.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain http://localhost https://www.example.com
ModPagespeedShardDomain https://www.example.com \
                        https://example1.cdn.com,https://example2.cdn.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed MapOriginDomain http://localhost https://www.example.com;
pagespeed ShardDomain https://www.example.com
                      https://example1.cdn.com,https://example2.cdn.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>In this example the https origin domain is mapped to <code>localhost</code>
<em>and</em> <a href="domains#shard">sharding</a> is used to parallelize
downloads across hostnames. Note that the shards also specify https.</p>

<p>By specifying a source domain in this directive, you are authorizing
PageSpeed to rewrite resources found in that domain.  For example, in the
above directives, '*.example.com' gets authorized for rewrites from HTML files,
but 'localhost' does not.  See <a href="#auth_domains"><code
>Domain</code></a>.</p>

<p>When PageSpeed fetches resources from a mapped origin domain, it
specifies the source domain in the <code>Host:</code> header in the
request.  You can override the <code>Host:</code> header value with the
optional third parameter <code>host_header</code>.  See
<a href="#shared_cdn">Mapping Origins with a Shared Domain</a> for
an example.</p>

<p>
  See also
  <a href="#ModPagespeedLoadFromFile"><code>LoadFromFile</code></a>
  to load origin resource directly from the filesystem and avoid an HTTP
  connection altogether.
</p>

<p>
These directives can be used
in <a href="configuration#htaccess">location-specific configuration
sections</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="mapping_rewrite">Mapping rewrite domains</h2>

<p>When PageSpeed rewrites a resource, it updates the HTML to
refer to the resource by its new name.  Generally PageSpeed leaves
the resource at the same origin and path that was originally found in
the HTML.  However, it is possible to map the domain of rewritten
resources.  Examples of why this might be desirable include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Serving static content from cookieless domains, to reduce the size of
    HTTP requests from the browser.  See
    <a href="/speed/docs/best-practices/payload">Minimizing Payload</a>
  <li>To move content to a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is done using the configuration file directive:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedMapRewriteDomain domain_to_write_into_html \
                             domain_specified_in_html</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed MapRewriteDomain domain_to_write_into_html
                           domain_specified_in_html;</pre>
</dl>

<p>Wildcards can also be used in the <code>domain_specified_in_html</code>, e.g.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMapRewriteDomain cdn.example.com *example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed MapRewriteDomain cdn.example.com *example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>The <code>domain_to_write_into_html</code> can include a path after the
domain name, e.g.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMapRewriteDomain cdn.com/example *.example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed MapRewriteDomain cdn.com/example *.example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>When a path is specified, the source domain is rewritten to the destination
domain and the source path is rewritten to the concatenation of the path from
<code>domain_to_write_into_html</code> and the source path. For example, given
the above mapping, <code>http://www.example.com/index.html</code> will be
rewritten to <code>http://cdn.com/example/index.html</code>.</p>

<p class="note" id="equiv_servers">
<strong>Note:</strong> It is the responsibility of the site administrator to
ensure that PageSpeed is installed on
the <code>domain_to_write_into_html</code>.  This might be a separate server, or
there may be a single server with multiple domains mapped into it.  The files
must be accessible via the same path on the destination server as was specified
in the HTML file.  No other files should be stored on the
<code>domain_to_write_into_html</code> -- it should be functionally equivalent
to <code>domain_specified_in_html</code>.  See
also <a href="#MapProxyDomain">MapProxyDomain</a> which enables proxying content
from a different server.</p>

<p>For example, if PageSpeed
cache_extends <code>http://www.example.com/styles/style.css</code> to
<code>http://cdn.example.com/styles/style.css.pagespeed.ce.HASH.css</code>,
then <code>cdn.example.com</code> will have to have a mechanism in place to
either rewrite that file in place, or refer back to the origin server to
pull the rewritten content.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> It is the responsibility of the site
administrator to ensure that moving resources onto domains does not
create a security vulnerability.  In particular, if the target domain
has cookies, then any JavaScript loaded from a resource moved to a
domain with cookies will gain access to those cookies.  In general,
moving resources to a cookieless domain is a great way to improve
security.  Be aware that CSS can load JavaScript in certain environments.
</p>

<p>By specifying a domain in this directive, either as source or destination,
you are authorizing PageSpeed to rewrite resources found in this
domain. See <a href="#auth_domains"><code>Domain</code></a>.</p>

<p>These directives can be used
in <a href="configuration#htaccess">location-specific configuration
sections</a>.</p>

<h3 id="shared_cdn">Mapping Origins with a Shared CDN</h3>

<p>Consider a scenario where an installation serving multiple domains
uses a single CDN for caching and delivery of all content.  The origin
fetches need to be routed to the correct VirtualHost on the server.
This can be achieved by using a subdirectory per domain in the
CDN, and then using that subdirectory to map to the correct
VirtualHost at origin.  The host-header control offered by the third
argument to <a href="#mapping_origin">MapOriginDomain</a> makes this
feasible.</p>

<p>In the example below, resources with a domain of
sharedcdn.example.com and path starting with /vhost1 will be fetched
from localhost but with a <code>Host:</code> header value of
vhost1.example.com.  Without the third argument to MapOriginDomain,
the <code>Host:</code> header would be sharedcdn.example.com.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain localhost sharedcdn.example.com/vhost1 vhost1.example.com
ModPagespeedMapRewriteDomain sharedcdn.example.com/vhost1 vhost1.example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed MapOriginDomain localhost sharedcdn.example.com/vhost1 vhost1.example.com;
pagespeed MapRewriteDomain sharedcdn.example.com/vhost1 vhost1.example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>This would be used in conjunction with a VirtualHost setup for
vhost1.example.com, and a single CDN setup for multple hosts segregated by
subdirectory.</p>

<h2 id="shard">Sharding domains</h2>

<p>Best practices suggest <a href="/speed/docs/best-practices/rtt"
>minimizing round-trip times</a> by <a
  href="/speed/docs/best-practices/rtt#ParallelizeDownloads"
>parallelizing downloads across hostnames</a>.  PageSpeed can partially
automate this for resources that it rewrites, using the directive:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedShardDomain domain_to_shard shard1,shard2,shard3...</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed ShardDomain domain_to_shard shard1,shard2,shard3...;</pre>
</dl>

<p>Wildcards cannot be used in this directive.</p>

<p>This will distribute the domains for rewritten URLs among the
specified shards.  The shard selected for a particular URL is computed
from the original URL.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedShardDomain example.com \
                        static1.example.com,static2.example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed ShardDomain example.com static1.example.com,static2.example.com;</pre>
</dl>


<p>
Using this directive, PageSpeed will distribute roughly half the
resources rewritten from example.com
into <code>static1.example.com</code>, and the rest to
<code>static2.example.com</code>.  You can specify as many shards as
you like.  The optimum number of shards is a topic of active
research, and is browser-dependent.  Configuring between 2 and 4
shards should yield good results.  Changing the number of shards
will cause PageSpeed to choose different names for resources,
resulting in a partial cache flush.</p>

<p>When used in combination with <code>RewriteDomain</code>, the Rewrite
mappings will be done first.  Then the shard selection occurs.  Origin domains
are always tracked so that when a browser sends a sharded URL back to the
server, PageSpeed can find it.
</p>
<p>Let's look at an example:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedShardDomain example.com static1.example.com,static2.example.com
ModPagespeedMapRewriteDomain example.com www.example.com
ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain localhost example.com</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed ShardDomain example.com static1.example.com,static2.example.com;
pagespeed MapRewriteDomain example.com www.example.com;
pagespeed MapOriginDomain localhost example.com;</pre>
</dl>

<p>In this example, <code>example.com</code>
and <code>www.example.com</code> are "tied" together via
<code>MapRewriteDomain</code>.  The origin-mapping
to <code>localhost</code> propagates automatically
to <code>www.example.com</code>, <code>static1.example.com</code>, and
<code>static2.example.com</code>.  So when PageSpeed cache-extends an HTML
stylesheet reference <code>http://www.example.com/styles.css</code>, it will be:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fetched by the server rewriting the HTML
    from <code>localhost</code></li>
  <li>Rewritten to
    <code>http://example.com/styles.css.pagespeed.ce.HASH.css</code></li>
  <li>Sharded to
    <code>http://static1.example.com/styles.css.pagespeed.ce.HASH.css</code>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="MapProxyDomain">Proxying and optimizing resources from
  trusted domains</h2>

<p>
  Proxying resources is desirable under several scenarios:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The resources on the origin domain may benefit from optimizations
    done by PageSpeed.</li>
  <li>SPDY may work better if there are fewer domains on a page.</li>
  <li>The target domain running PageSpeed may have better serving
    infrastructure than the origin.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is possible to proxy and optimize resources whose origin is a trusted
  domain that may not be running PageSpeed. This cannot be directly achieved
  with MapRewriteDomain because that is a declaration that the domains listed
  are functionally equivalent to one another, either because they are backed by
  the same storage, or because the target is acting as a proxy (e.g. a
  CDN).  <code>MapProxyDomain</code> makes it technically possible to proxy and
  optimize resources from any domain <b>that you trust</b>.

<p class="warning">
  You must only proxy resources that are controlled by an organization
  you <b>trust</b> because it is possible for malicious content (e.g.
  <a href="http://hackaday.com/2008/08/04/the-gifar-image-vulnerability/"
     >GIFAR</a>)
  proxied from an untrustworthy domain to gain access to private
  content on your domain, compromising your site or its viewers. You
  must never map directories that may contain files that may be
  controlled by a third party.
</p>
<p class="warning">
  There may be legal issues restricting the optimization of resources
  you don't own.  If in doubt consult a lawyer.
  {# TODO(jmarantz): it should be possible to use this directive in #}
  {# combination with Disallow & rewrite_domains to proxy without   #}
  {# optimizing.  A demo/test of that will be left for a follow-up. #}
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedMapProxyDomain target_domain/subdir \
                           origin_domain/subdir [rewrite_domain/subdir]
</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed MapProxyDomain target_domain/subdir
                         origin_domain/subdir [rewrite_domain/subdir];</pre>
</dl>

<p>
If the optional rewrite_domain/subdir argument is supplied then optimized
resources will be rewritten to that location.  This is useful for rewriting
optimized resources proxied from an external origin to a CDN.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to specify a subdirectory in the target domain, because
  PageSpeed will need to be able to unambiguously identify the
  origin domain given the target when fetching content. Thus each
  MapProxyDomain command should be given a distinct subdirectory
  of the target domain.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to specify a subdirectory in the origin domain to
  limit the scope of the proxying. For example,
  in <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com">picasaweb</a>, all of a user's
  photos are underneath a single subdirectory; it is critical not to enable
  proxying for the entire site.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
You can see proxy-mapping in action at <code>www.modpagespeed.com</code> on this
<a href="http://www.modpagespeed.com/proxy_external_resource.html">example</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="fetch_servers">Fetch server restrictions</h2>
  <p> PageSpeed will only fetch resources from <code>localhost</code> and
  domains explicitly mentioned in domain configuration directives such
  as <code>Domain</code>, <code>MapRewriteDomain</code>
  and <code>MapOriginDomain</code>. As this security restriction is not
  desirable for some large deployments, in Apache it is possible to disable it
  starting from 0.10.22.7, via the following configuration directive (which has
  a global effect): <pre class="prettyprint"
  >ModPagespeedDangerPermitFetchFromUnknownHosts on</pre>

  <p class="warning"><strong>Warning: </strong>Enabling
  <code>DangerPermitFetchFromUnknownHosts</code> could permit
  hostile third parties to access any machine and port that the server running
  mod_pagespeed has access to, including potentially those behind firewalls.
  </p>
  Before doing this, however, it must be ensured that at least one of these
  things is true:
  <ol>
    <li>The server running mod_pagespeed has no more access to machines or
    ports than anyone on the Internet, and that machines it can access will
    not treat its traffic specially (mod_pagespeed 0.10.22.6 and newer will
    make sure its own traffic to <code>localhost</code> does not appear to be
    local, but that does not work across machines)</li>
    <li>Every virtual host in Apache running mod_pagespeed (and, if applicable,
    the global configuration) has an accurate explicit <code>ServerName</code>,
    and sets the options <code>UseCanonicalName</code> and
    <code>UseCanonicalPhysicalPort</code> to <code>On</code>.
    <li>A proxy running in front of the mod_pagespeed server fully verifies that
    the URLs and <code>Host:</code> headers that reach it refer only to machines
    the mod_pagespeed server is expected to contact.
  </ol>
  If possible, you are strongly encouraged to use
  <code>MapOriginDomain</code> in preference to this switch.
</p>

<h2 id="url-valued-attributes">Specifying additional URL-valued attributes</h2>

<p>
  All PageSpeed filters that process URLs need to know which attributes of
  which elements to consider.  By default they consider those in the HTML4 and
  HTML5 specifications and a few common extensions:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;a href=...&gt;
  &lt;area href=...&gt;
  &lt;audio src=...&gt;
  &lt;blockquote cite=...&gt;
  &lt;body background=...&gt;
  &lt;button formaction=...&gt;
  &lt;command icon=...&gt;
  &lt;del cite=...&gt;
  &lt;embed src=...&gt;
  &lt;form action=...&gt;
  &lt;frame src=...&gt;
  &lt;html manifest=...&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=...&gt;
  &lt;img src=...&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;image&quot; src=...&gt;
  &lt;ins cite=...&gt;
  &lt;link href=...&gt;
  &lt;q cite=...&gt;
  &lt;script src=...&gt;
  &lt;source src=...&gt;
  &lt;td background=...&gt;
  &lt;th background=...&gt;
  &lt;table background=...&gt;
  &lt;tbody background=...&gt;
  &lt;tfoot background=...&gt;
  &lt;thead background=...&gt;
  &lt;track src=...&gt;
  &lt;video src=...&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  If your site uses a non-standard attribute for URLs, PageSpeed won't
  know to rewrite them or the resources they reference.  To identify them to
  PageSpeed, use the <code>UrlValuedAttribute</code> directive.
  For example:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedUrlValuedAttribute span src hyperlink
ModPagespeedUrlValuedAttribute div background image</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed UrlValuedAttribute span src hyperlink;
pagespeed UrlValuedAttribute div background image;</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  These would identify <code>&lt;span src=...&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div
  background=...&gt;</code> as containing URLs.  Further,
  the <code>background</code> attribute of <code>div</code> elements would be
  treated as referring to an image and would be treated just like an image
  resource referenced with <code>&lt;img src=...&gt;</code>.  The general form
  is:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedUrlValuedAttribute ELEMENT ATTRIBUTE CATEGORY</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed UrlValuedAttribute ELEMENT ATTRIBUTE CATEGORY;</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  All fields are case-insensitive.
  <span id="categories">Valid categories are:</span>
  <ul>
    <li><code>script</code></li>
    <li><code>image</code></li>
    <li><code>stylesheet</code> (As of 1.12.34.1)</li>
    <li><code>otherResource</code>
      <ul><li>Any other URL that will be automatically loaded by the
              browser along with the main page.  For example,
              the <code>manifest</code> attribute of the <code>html</code>
              element or the <code>src</code> attribute of
              an <code>iframe</code> element.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>hyperlink</code>
      <ul><li>A link to another page or resource that a browser wouldn't
              normally load in connection to this page (like
              the <code>href</code> attribute of an <code>a</code> element).
              These URLs will still be rewritten
              by <code>MapRewriteDomain</code> and similar directives, but they
              will not be sharded and PageSpeed will not load the URL and
              rewrite the resource.</li></ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  When in doubt, <code>hyperlink</code> is the safest choice.

<p class="note">
  <b>Note:</b> Until 1.12.34.1, <code>stylesheet</code> was accepted by the
  configuration parser, but was non-functional.
</p>

</p>

<h2 id="ModPagespeedLoadFromFile">Loading static files from disk</h2>
<p>
  By default PageSpeed loads sub-resources via an HTTP fetch.  It would be
  faster to load sub-resources directly from the filesystem, however this may
  not be safe to do because the sub-resources may be dynamically generated or
  the sub-resources may not be stored on the same server.
</p>
<p>
  However, you can explicitly tell PageSpeed to load static sub-resources from
  disk by using the <code>LoadFromFile</code> directive. For example:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLoadFromFile "http://www.example.com/static/" \
                         "/var/www/static/"</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFile "http://www.example.com/static/"
                       "/var/www/static/";</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  tells PageSpeed to load all resources whose URLs start
  with <code>http://www.example.com/static/</code> from the filesystem
  under <code>/var/www/static/</code>.  For
  example, <code>http://www.example.com/static/images/foo.png</code> will be
  loaded from the file <code>/var/www/static/images/foo.png</code>.
  However, <code>http://www.example.com/bar.jpg</code> will still be fetched
  using HTTP.
</p>
<p>
  If you need more sophisticated prefix-matching behavior, you can use
  the <code>LoadFromFileMatch</code> directive, which
  supports <a href="https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax">RE2-format</a>
  regular expressions.  (Note that this is not the same format as the wildcards
  used above and elsewhere in PageSpeed.)  For example:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLoadFromFileMatch "^https?://example.com/~([^/]*)/static/" \
                              "/var/www/static/\\1"</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFileMatch "^https?://example.com/~([^/]*)/static/"
                            "/var/www/static/\\1";</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  Will load <code>http://example.com/~pat/static/cat.jpg</code> from
  <code>/var/www/static/pat/cat.jpg</code>,
  <code>http://example.com/~sam/static/images/dog.jpg</code> from
  <code>/var/www/static/sam/images/dog.jpg</code>, and
  <code>https://example.com/~al/static/css/ie</code> from
  <code>/var/www/static/al/css/ie</code>.  The resource
  <code>http://example.com/~pat/images/static/puppy.gif</code>, however,
  would not be matched by this directive and would be fetched using HTTP.
</p>
<p>
  Because PageSpeed is loading the files directly from the filesystem, no custom
  headers will be set. For example, no headers set with the <code>Header
  set</code> (Apache) or <code>add_header</code> (Nginx) directives will be
  applied to these resources.  If you have resources that need to be served with
  custom headers, such as <code>Cache-Control: private</code>, you need to
  exclude them from <code>LoadFromFile</code>.  For resources PageSpeed
  rewrites <a href="system#ipro">in-place</a> it will set a 5-minute cache
  lifetime by default, which you can adjust by
  changing <a href="system#load_from_file_cache_ttl"><code
  >LoadFromFileCacheTtlMs</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the content type will be set based
  upon only the filename extension and only for common filename extensions we
  recognize (<code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code>,
  <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.jpeg</code>, ... see full
  list: <a href="https://github.com/pagespeed/mod_pagespeed/blob/master/pagespeed/kernel/http/content_type.cc">content_type.cc</a>).
  Before 1.9.32.1, filenames with unrecognized extensions were served with no
  <code>Content-Type</code> header; in 1.9.32.1 and later such filenames will
  not be loaded from file and instead will fall back to ordinary fetching.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use the <code>LoadFromFile</code> directive to
  load HTTPS resources which would not be otherwise fetchable directly.
  For example:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLoadFromFile "https://www.example.com/static/" \
                         "/var/www/static/"</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFile "https://www.example.com/static/"
                       "/var/www/static/";</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  The filesystem path must be an absolute path.
</p>
<p>
  You can specify multiple <code>LoadFromFile</code> associations in
  configuration files.  Note that large numbers of such directives may impact
  performance.
</p>
<p>
  If the sub-resource cannot be loaded from file in the directory
  specified, the sub-request will fail (rather than fall back to
  HTTP fetch). Part of the reason for this is to indicate a configuration
  error more clearly.
</p>
<p>
  As an added benefit. If resources are loaded from file, the rewritten
  versions will be updated immediately when you change the associated file.
  Resources loaded via normal HTTP fetches are refreshed only when they
  expire from the cache (by default every 5 minutes). Therefore, the
  rewritten versions are only updated as often as the cache is refreshed.
  Resources loaded from file are not subject to caching behavior because
  they are accessed directly from the filesystem for every request for the
  rewritten version.

<h4 id="limiting-load-from-file">Limiting Direct Loading</h4>
<p>
  A mapping set up with <code>LoadFromFile</code> allows filesystem loading for
  anything it matches.  If you have directories or file types that cannot be
  loaded directly from the filesystem, <code>LoadFromFileRule</code> lets you
  add fine-grained rules to control which files will be loaded directly and
  which will fall back to the standard process, over HTTP.
</p>
<p>
  When given a URL PageSpeed first determines whether any LoadFromFile
  mappings apply.  If one does, it calculates the mapped filename and checks for
  applicable LoadFromFileRules.  Considering rules in the reverse order of
  definition, it takes the first applicable one and uses that to determine
  whether to load from file or fall back to HTTP.
</p>
<p>
  Some examples may be helpful.  Consider a website that is entirely static
  content except for a <code>/cgi-bin</code> directory:
</p>
<pre>
  /var/www/index.html
  /var/www/pets.html
  /var/www/images/cat.jpg
  /var/www/stylesheets/main.css
  /var/www/stylesheets/ie.css
  /var/www/cgi-bin/guestbook.pl
  /var/www/cgi-bin/visitcounter.pl
</pre>
<p>
  While most of the site can be loaded directly from the
  filesystem, <code>guestbook.pl</code> and <code>visitcounter.pl</code> are
  perl files that need to be interpreted before serving.  Adding a rule
  disallowing the <code>/cgi-bin</code> directory tells us to fall back to HTTP
  appropriately:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLoadFromFile http://example.com/ /var/www/
ModPagespeedLoadFromFileRule Disallow /var/www/cgi-bin/</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFile http://example.com/ /var/www/;
pagespeed LoadFromFileRule Disallow /var/www/cgi-bin/;</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  The <code>LoadFromFileRule</code> directive takes two arguments.
  The first must be either <code>Allow</code> or <code>Disallow</code> while the
  second is a prefix that specifies which filesystem paths it should apply to.
  Because the default is to allow loading from the filesystem for all paths
  listed in any <code>LoadFromFile</code> statement, most of the time you will
  be using <code>Disallow</code> to turn off filesystem loading for some subset
  of those paths.  You would use <code>Allow</code> only after
  a <code>Disallow</code> that was overly general.
</p>
<p>
  Not all sites are well suited for prefix-based control.  Consider a site with
  PHP files mixed in with ordinary static files:
</p>
<pre>
  /var/www/index.html
  /var/www/webmail.php
  /var/www/webmail.css
  /var/www/blog/index.php
  /var/www/blog/header.png
  /var/www/blog/blog.css
</pre>
<p>
  Blacklisting just the <code>.php</code> files so they fall back to an HTTP
  fetch allows everything else to be loaded directly from the filesystem:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLoadFromFile http://example.com/ /var/www/
ModPagespeedLoadFromFileRuleMatch Disallow \.php$</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFile http://example.com/ /var/www/;
pagespeed LoadFromFileRuleMatch Disallow \.php$;</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  The <code>LoadFromFileRuleMatch</code> directive also takes two arguments.
  The first is either <code>Allow</code> or <code>Disallow</code> and functions
  just like for <code>LoadFromFileRule</code> above.  The second argument,
  however, is
  a <a href="https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax">RE2-format</a> regular
  expression instead of a file prefix.  Remember to escape characters that have
  special meaning in regular expressions.  For example, if instead
  of <code>\.php$</code> we had simply <code>.php$</code> then a file
  named <code>example.notphp</code> would still be forced to load over HTTP
  because "<code>.</code>" is special syntax for "match any single character".
</p>
<p>
  Consider a site with the opposite problem: a few file types can be reliably
  loaded from file but the rest need interpretation first.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
  /var/www/index.html
  /var/www/site.css
  /var/www/script-using-ssi.js
  /var/www/generate-image.pl
  /var/www/
</pre>
<p>
  This site uses server side includes
  (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/ssi.html">Apache</a>,
  <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSsiModule">Nginx</a>)
  in its javascript and <code>generate-image.pl</code> needs to be interpreted
  to make images.  The only resources on the site that are generally safe to
  load are <code>.css</code> ones.  By first blacklisting everything and then
  whitelisting only the <code>.css</code> files, we can make PageSpeed do this:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLoadFromFile http://example.com/ /var/www/
ModPagespeedLoadFromFileRuleMatch disallow .*
ModPagespeedLoadFromFileRuleMatch allow \.css$</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFile http://example.com/ /var/www/;
pagespeed LoadFromFileRuleMatch disallow .*;
pagespeed LoadFromFileRuleMatch allow \.css$;</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  This works because order is significant: later rules take precedence over
  earlier ones.
</p>

<h3 id="LoadFromFileScriptVariables">Script Variables with LoadFromFile</h3>
<p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.9.32.1</strong></p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note: Nginx-only</strong></p>

<p>
  As of 1.9.32.1 Nginx <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html">script
  variables</a> are now supported with the various <code>LoadFromFile</code>
  directives.  Script support for those options makes it possible to configure a
  generic mapping of http hosts to disk, to reduce the amount of configuration
  required when you want to load as much from disk as possible but have a lot
  of <code>server{}</code> blocks.
</p>

<p>
  As an example, consider one server that hosts three sites, each of which have
  a directory <code>/static</code> that holds static resources and can be loaded
  from file.  One way to configure this server would be:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
http {
  ...
  server {
    server_name a.example.com;
    pagespeed LoadFromFile http://a.example.com/static /var/www-a/static;
    ...
  }
  server {
    server_name b.example.com;
    pagespeed LoadFromFile http://b.example.com/static /var/www-b/static;
    ...
  }
  server {
    server_name c.example.com;
    pagespeed LoadFromFile http://c.example.com/static /var/www-c/static;
    ...
  }
}</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  For three sites this is kind of annoying, but the more sites you have the
  worse it gets.  With <code>ProcessScriptVariables</code> you can define one
  generic <code>LoadFromFile</code> mapping instead of defining each one
  individually:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
http {
  ...
  pagespeed ProcessScriptVariables on;
  pagespeed LoadFromFile "http://$host/static" "$document_root/static";

  server {
    server_name a.example.com;
    ...
  }
  server {
    server_name b.example.com;
    ...
  }
  server {
    server_name c.example.com;
    ...
  }
}</pre>
</dl>

<p>
  This will use Nginx's <code>$host</code> and <code>$document_root</code>
  script variables instead of requiring you to explicitly code each one.
</p>

<p>
  For more details on script variables, including how to handle dollar signs,
  see <a href="system#nginx_script_variables">Script Variable Support</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="risks">Risks</h3>
<p>
  This should only be used for completely static resources which do not
  need any custom headers or special server processing. If non-static
  resources exist in the specified directory, the source code will
  be used without applying SSI includes, CGI generation, etc.
  Furthermore, all the resources should have filenames with common
  extensions for their Content-Type (Ex: .html, .css, .js, .jpg, .jpeg, ... see
  full list: <a href="https://github.com/pagespeed/mod_pagespeed/blob/master/pagespeed/kernel/http/content_type.cc">content_type.cc</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="inline_without_auth">Inlining resources without explicit authorization
</h2>
<p>
  Several filters in PageSpeed operate by inlining content from resources into
  the HTML: inline_css, inline_javascript and prioritize_critical_css are a
  few of the filters that operate in this manner. If resources from
  third-party domains are not authorized explicitly, the effectiveness of
  these filters decreases. For instance, prioritize_critical_css attempts to
  remove blocking CSS requests needed for the initial render by inlining
  critical CSS snippets into the HTML, however, the CSS resources that are not
  authorized will continue to block. This option allows such resources to
  be inlined without having to authorize all the individual domains.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>InlineResourcesWithoutExplicitAuthorization</code>
  directive can be used to allow resources from third-party domains to be
  inlined into the HTML without requiring explicit authorization for each
  domain. This option is “off” by default, and takes a
  comma-separated list of strings representing resource categories for which
  the option should be enabled. The list of valid resource categories is
  given <a href="#categories">here</a>. Currently, only Script and
  Stylesheet resource types are supported for this option.
</p>

This option can be enabled as follows:
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedInlineResourcesWithoutExplicitAuthorization Script,Stylesheet
</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed InlineResourcesWithoutExplicitAuthorization Script,Stylesheet;
</pre>
</dl>

  <p class="warning"><strong>Warning: </strong>Enabling
  <code>InlineResourcesWithoutExplicitAuthorization</code> could permit
  hostile third parties to access any machine and port that the server running
  mod_pagespeed has access to, including potentially those behind firewalls.
  Please read the following information for details.
  </p>
<p>
  This directive should only be enabled if all of the following conditions are
  met for the resource types for which this option is enabled:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The webmaster is confident that the resources referenced on their pages are
   from trusted domains only.
</li>
<li>The site does not allow user-injected resources for the enabled resource
    types.
</li>
<li>Fetches from the PageSpeed server should have no
   more access to machines or ports than anyone on the Internet, and machines it
   can access should not treat its traffic specially. Specifically, the
   PageSpeed servers should not be able to access anything that is internal to a
   firewall. Please refer to <a href="#fetch_servers">
   Fetch server restrictions</a> sections for more details.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Note that resources inlined into HTML via this option will not be accessible
  directly via a pagespeed URL, since that involves different security risks.
  Resources will also not be inlined into other non-HTML resources via this
  option. This  means that flatten_css_imports will not flatten third-party CSS
  into another CSS resource, unless the relevant third-party domains are
  authorized explicitly via one of the techniques mentioned in the previous
  sections.
