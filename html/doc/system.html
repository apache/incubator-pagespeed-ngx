<h1>PageSpeed System Integration</h1>
    <h2 id="caching">Configuring Caching</h2>
    <p>
      PageSpeed requires publicly cacheable resources to provide
      maximum benefit.  As discussed in the "Cache Extender" filter, the
      origin TTL specified in the server configuration file dictates how
      quickly changes made to the source can propagate to users' browser
      caches.  However, using PageSpeed, resources referenced statically
      from HTML files will be served with a one-year cache lifetime, but
      with a URL that is versioned using a content hash.
    </p>

    <h2 id="server_cache">Configuring Server-Side Cache for PageSpeed</h2>
    <p>
      In order to rewrite resources, PageSpeed must cache them server-side.  A
      file-system based cache is always employed on each
      server.  <a href="#memcached">memcached</a> or <a href="#redis">redis</a>
      may be used as a scalable network-accessible cache in addition to the file
      cache.  The file cache is always required, since PageSpeed has a few
      things it needs to store locally.  Finally, a per-process in-memory LRU
      cache and/or an interprocess shared-memory cache can be configured for
      rapid access to small objects.
    </p>

    <h3 id="file_cache">Configuring the File Cache</h3>
    <p>
      PageSpeed must be configured with a path where it can write
      cache files, tuned to limit the amount of disk space consumed.
      The file cache can be placed on
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs">tmpfs</a>
      partition or on a physical disk.  The file cache has a built-in
      LRU mechanism to remove old files, targeting a certain total
      disk space usage, and a certain interval for the cleanup
      process.  An example configuration is:
    </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedFileCachePath            "/var/cache/pagespeed/"
ModPagespeedFileCacheSizeKb          102400
ModPagespeedFileCacheCleanIntervalMs 3600000
ModPagespeedFileCacheInodeLimit      500000</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed FileCachePath              "/var/cache/pagespeed/";
pagespeed FileCacheSizeKb            102400;
pagespeed FileCacheCleanIntervalMs   3600000;
pagespeed FileCacheInodeLimit        500000;</pre>
</dl>
    <p>
      It is important to note that <code>FileCacheSizeKb</code> and
      <code>FileCacheInodeLimit</code> do not define absolute limits
      on the cache size and inode count. The cache cleaning process will run at
      the time interval defined by
      <code>FileCacheCleanIntervalMs</code>, and will only initiate
      cleaning if the cache size exceeds
      <code>FileCacheSizeKb</code> or the cache inode count exceeds
      <code>FileCacheInodeLimit</code>. When cache cleaning is
      initiated, the oldest files in the cache will be removed until the cache
      size is under <code>0.75 * FileCacheSizeKb</code> and the
      inode count is under <code>0.75 * FileCacheInodeLimit</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      <b>Warning:</b> Because the file cache cleaner does not impose a tight
      bound on disk usage, if your site is large and receives heavy traffic
      PageSpeed's cache can expand to fill your entire disk.  If this becomes a
      problem you must either use a sufficiently large disk that this can't
      happen, or a cache whose size is guaranteed to be bounded.  Bounded caches
      include keeping your file cache on a PageSpeed-specific
      partition, <a href="#memcached">memcached</a>,
      and <a href="#redis">redis</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PageSpeed previously reserved another file-path for future use as a shared
      database in a multi-server environment.  This is no longer in the plan,
      and <code>GeneratedFilePrefix</code> now generates a deprecation warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in version 1.12.34.1, it is possible to disable cache cleaning
      entirely, making PageSpeed ignore the limits set
      by <code>FileCacheSizeKb</code> and <code>FileCacheInodeLimit</code>.  To
      do this, set <code>FileCacheCleanIntervalMs</code> to -1:
    </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedFileCacheCleanIntervalMs -1</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed FileCacheCleanIntervalMs -1;</pre>
</dl>
    <p>
      In versions before 1.12.34.1, using a large number for the interval, like
      <code>1576800000000</code> (fifty years), has the same effect.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      <b>Warning:</b> Without cleaning the cache will grow without bound as
      PageSpeed continues to store additional resources.  If you disable the
      built-in cache cleaner you must implement something yourself to ensure
      that PageSpeed does not consume all available disk space for its cache.
    </p>

    <h3 id="lru_cache">Configuring the in-memory LRU Cache</h3>
    <p>
      To optimize performance, a small in-memory write-through LRU cache can be
      instantiated in each server process.  Note that in Apache's pre-fork mode
      this means dozens of processes, so the total memory consumed
      (<code>LRUCacheKbPerProcess * num_processes</code>) must fit into the
      capabilities of the host machine.  Nginx typically runs with many fewer
      processes, so a larger <code>LRUCacheKbPerProcess</code> is appropriate
      there. The <code>LRUCacheByteLimit</code> is the limit on how large a
      cache entry the LRU cache will accept.  A sample configuration is:
    </p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedLRUCacheKbPerProcess   1024
ModPagespeedLRUCacheByteLimit      16384</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LRUCacheKbPerProcess     8192;
pagespeed LRUCacheByteLimit        16384;</pre>
</dl>

    <h3 id="shm_cache">Configuring the Shared Memory Metadata Cache</h3>

    <p>As part of its operation, PageSpeed stores summaries of how to apply
    optimizations to web pages as part of a <em>metadata cache</em>.  Metadata
    entries are small and frequently accessed. They should ideally be stored in
    local memory and shared across server processes, as opposed to on disk or
    an <a href="#external_cache">external cache</a>.  That is exactly what the
    shared memory metadata cache does, and it is the best place to cache your
    metadata entries.</p>

    <p>Prior to 1.12.34.1, writes to an explicitly configured shared memory
    metadata cache were in-memory only, and not written to disk. This provided a
    large performance boost but the contents of the cache were lost upon server
    restart.</p>

    <p>As of 1.12.34.1, PageSpeed checkpoints the shared memory metadata cache
    to disk, providing almost all the performance but without the cache being
    wiped on restart. By default the metadata cache is checkpointed every 5
    minutes, see <a href="#shm_checkpointing">shared memory checkpointing</a>
    for more details.</p>

    <p>In all versions, if you enable an <a href="#external_cache">external
    cache</a>, cache entries are written through to it.</p>

    <p>The shared memory metadata cache is enabled using
    the <code>CreateSharedMemoryMetadataCache</code> directive.  This directive
    takes two arguments. The first is the exact string given as the argument
    to <code>FileCachePath</code> in any virtual host where you want this cache
    active. The second is the size of the cache in kilobytes. Unlike the LRU
    cache, this cache is shared among all server processes, so far larger values
    are possible. For example:

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedCreateSharedMemoryMetadataCache "/var/cache/pagespeed/" 51200
&lt;VirtualHost www.example.com:80&gt;
  ModPagespeedFileCachePath "/var/cache/pagespeed/"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;VirtualHost alt.example.com:80&gt;
  ModPagespeedFileCachePath "/var/cache/pagespeed/"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed CreateSharedMemoryMetadataCache "/var/cache/pagespeed/" 51200;
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name www.example.com;
  pagespeed FileCachePath "/var/cache/pagespeed/";
}
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name alt.example.com;
  pagespeed FileCachePath "/var/cache/pagespeed/";
}</pre>
</dl>

    will create a 50-megabyte metadata cache used for both www.example.com and
    alt.example.com, and shared among all server processes.

    <p>If you are currently using a file cache, you can estimate a good size for
    this cache by measuring the size of the <code>rname/</code> directory of
    the on-disk cache, using the <code>du -s -h --apparent-size</code> command,
    for example:
<pre class="prettyprint-sh">
du -s -h --apparent-size /path/to/pagespeed_cache/rname
</pre>

  then, multiplying the result by 1.75 and converting it to kilobytes.</p>

  <p> You can see how effective this layer of cache is at the
  <a href="configuration#virtual-hosts-and-stats">global PageSpeed
  statistics</a> page, where at the bottom of the page every shared
  memory cache will be listed, including in particular information on its hit
  rate and how full it is (blocks used). </p>

    <h3 id="default_shm_cache">Default Shared Memory Metadata Cache</h3>
    <p>
      Any virtual host that does not have a <a href="#shm_cache">shared memory
      metadata cache</a> configured
      with <code>CreateSharedMemoryMetadataCache</code> will share a default
      one.  In versions 1.12.34.1 and later, snapshots of the shared memory
      cache are periodically saved to disk via <a href="#shm_checkpointing"
      >shared memory checkpointing</a>.  Versions prior to 1.12.34.1 did not
      support snapshotting, and instead wrote all changes through to disk,
      significantly degrading the write performance of the shared memory cache.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can configure the size of this cache
      with <code>DefaultSharedMemoryCacheKB</code>, or disable it entirely by
      setting the size to 0.  The default size is 50MB, and is shared across all
      server processes.
    </p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedDefaultSharedMemoryCacheKB 50000</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed DefaultSharedMemoryCacheKB 50000;</pre>
</dl>

    <p>
      This directive can only be used at the top level of your configuration.
    </p>

    <h3 id="shm_checkpointing">Shared Memory Metadata Cache Checkpointing</h3>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.12.34.1</strong></p>
    <p>
      Shared memory caches are fast but have the significant disadvantage that
      they do not survive a server restart.  The file cache does persist across
      restarts but performs significantly worse than an in-memory cache.
      Checkpointing attempts to provide a balance by using the same fast
      in-memory cache and periodically writing its contents to disk. In practice
      this can perform almost as well as a straight memory cache, with the
      significant advantage that it also survives a server restart, as the
      checkpoint is read into memory at startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're using an <a href="#external_cache">external cache</a>, all
      writes to the shared memory metadata cache are written out to the external
      cache so that other servers using the same external cache can avoid
      redundant optimization.  In this configuration, the checkpoint is not
      written through to the external cache when it is restored, because this
      could overwrite the work of other servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checkpointing is enabled by default, running every five minutes.  You can
      adjust this interval by
      setting <code>ShmMetadataCacheCheckpointIntervalSec</code>, and you can
      disable checkpointing entirely by setting it to -1.
    </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedShmMetadataCacheCheckpointIntervalSec 300</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed ShmMetadataCacheCheckpointIntervalSec 300;</pre>
</dl>
     <p>
       This directive can only be used at the top level of your configuration.
     </p>
     <p>
       Note that if you disable checkpointing, the shared memory cache will not
       be written to disk, and all optimizations will be lost on server restart.
     </p>
     <p>
       If you have multiple file caches enabled, PageSpeed has to pick one to
       use for snapshots for the default shared memory cache.  It resolves this
       by taking the file cache path that comes first alphabetically and putting
       all snapshots there.
     </p>

    <h3 id="external_cache">External Caches</h3>

    <p>
      PageSpeed supports two different external
      caches, <a href="#memcached">memcached</a> and <a href="#redis">redis</a>.
      The main reasons to use an external cache are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to run multiple PageSpeed servers without
          duplicating optimizations.
      <li>You want to allocate more memory to PageSpeed's cache than a single
          machine an provide.
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can configure different external caches for different virtual hosts,
      but you can't use both memcached and redis for the same virtual host.
    </p>


    <h4 id="memcached">Configuring memcached</h3>
    <p>
      To enable <a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a>, specify the list
      of memcached servers with a comma-separated list of hosts and ports.  If
      the port is omitted, the default memcached port of 11211 is assumed.
      PageSpeed's memcached integration by uses a background thread for
      communicating with the memcached servers.  This allows PageSpeed to batch
      multiple Get requests into a single MultiGet request to memcached, which
      improves performance and reduces network round trips.
    </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMemcachedServers "host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3"</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed MemcachedServers "host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3";</pre>
</dl>
    <p class="note">
      To start memcached with 1Gb of memory, use <code>memcached -p PORT -m 1024
      -u WEBSERVER_USERNAME</code>.  The default size of 64Mb might be too low
      for large sites.  See <a
        href="https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/ConfiguringServer">the
      wiki</a> for detailed memcached configuration help.  Be aware that
      configuring scalable caching requires tuning and iteration.  You must be
      sure that the user-id running the server has permission to access
      memcached.  For example, on CentOS, you may need to run memcached
      with:
      <dl>
        <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
           >memcached -p PORT -m MEMORY_IN_MEGABYTES -u apache</pre>
        <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
           >memcached -p PORT -m MEMORY_IN_MEGABYTES -u nginx</pre>
      </dl>
      If SELinux is enabled, then you must also grant permission for the
      server to access the memcached port.  Failure to do this results in
      'permission denied' warnings in the error logs and will prevent
      PageSpeed from optimizing resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you use memcached with PageSpeed, many vital memcached statistics can
      be found
      at
      <dl>
        <dt>Apache:<dd><pre

           >http://localhost/ngx_pagespeed_statistics?memcached</pre>
      </dl>
      These statistics are taken both from the PageSpeed perspective,
      aggregating all memcacheds as viewed from a single server...

    <p>
      By default, PageSpeed uses a half-second (500,000 microsecond) timeout for
      cache operations.  If the timeout is exceeded more than 4 times in a 30
      second span, PageSpeed assumes that memcached is not healthy and will stop
      optimizing resources for 30 seconds before trying again.
    </p>

    <p>
      For wide area networks or for alternative implementations and proxies of
      the memcache protocol such as couchbase or moxi-server it may be necessary
      to increase the I/O timeout.  Please monitor the statistic
      'memcache_timeouts' to help tune the timeouts.  Select a new timeout with
      the <code>MemcachedTimeoutUs</code> directive:

    <h2 id="flush_cache">Flushing PageSpeed Server-Side Cache</h2>
    <p>
      When developing web pages with PageSpeed enabled, it is
      sometimes convenient to flush the cache of a running server, in
      order to get the system to reload CSS or JavaScript files that
      have been updated before the origin cache lifetime expires.
    </p>
    <h3 id="flush_cache_legacy">Legacy Flushing Of Entire Cache</h3>
    <p>
      By default, the system is configured to support only whole-cache
      flushes &mdash; we'll call this <em>legacy mode</em>.  As
      of <strong>version 1.9.32.1</strong>, it can be configured to
      also allow purging of individual URLs.  The two modes operate
      differently and you may choose between them for each virtual
      host.  Legacy mode is on by default, to provide compatibility
      with existing scripts and other infrastructure that might have
      been built around it.  In a future release, individual URL
      purging will become the default.  Subsequent to that, the legacy
      whole-cache flushing mode will be eliminated.

      You can choose between the two modes with
      the <code>EnableCachePurge</code> argument.  If set to "on" you
      will get the new behavior, with individual URL purging, while
      "off" will give you the legacy behavior.  The default is "off",
      as if your configuration read:
    </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedEnableCachePurge off</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed EnableCachePurge off;</pre>
</dl>
    <p>
      In this mode, simply touch the file "cache.flush" in the directory
      specified as <code>FileCachePath</code> above.  For example:
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
  sudo touch /var/cache/pagespeed/cache.flush
</pre>
    <p>
      The system may take up to 5 seconds to take effect (changeable via option
      <code>CacheFlushPollIntervalSec</code> described
      <a href="#purge_options">below</a>).

    <h3 id="purge_cache">Purging individual cache entries or entire cache</h3>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.9.32.1</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this mode, the cache may be purged by sending HTTP requests
      to the server, using a configurable
      path. The cache can be purged via
      an HTTP GET, PURGE, or DELETE, once a handler has been
      <a href="admin#config">configured</a>. The <a href="admin">admin
        site</a> makes this easier by providing a graphical interface to
      initiate purge requests and see what entries have been purged.
    </p>
    <p>To enable individual URL cache purging, you must
      <a href="admin#config">configure the admin site</a>,
      specify a PurgeMethod, or both.  Plus you must turn on
      EnableCachePurge:
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
                      >ModPagespeedEnableCachePurge on
ModPagespeedPurgeMethod PURGE &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>(optional)</em></dd></pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed EnableCachePurge on;
pagespeed PurgeMethod PURGE; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>(optional)</em></dd></pre>
</dl>
    <p>
      This establishes three methods to purge the cache of a URL, or to
      purge the entire cache, assuming PageSpeed is running on example.com:
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Purge single URL</th>
            <th>Purge entire cache</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>HTTP GET</td>
            <td><code>curl 'http://example.com/pagespeed_admin/cache?purge=path/file.ext'</code></td>
            <td><code>curl 'http://example.com/pagespeed_admin/cache?purge=*'</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>HTTP PURGE</td>
            <td><code>curl --request PURGE 'http://www.example.com/path/file.ext'</code></td>
            <td><code>curl --request PURGE 'http://www.example.com/*'</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Admin GUI</td>
            <td><img src="images/purge_one_url.png"></td>
            <td><img src="images/purge_entire_cache.png"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Purge requests for individual URLs made via the GUI are
      executed via an HTTP GET.  In either case, the URL being purged
      is specified relative to the ORIGIN of the admin site.  In these
      examples, <code>path/file.ext</code> is combined
      with <code>example.com</code> to purge the path
      <code>http://example.com/path/file.ext</code> from the cache.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the new mode of cache purging is enabled, the purges take
      place immediately, there is no five second delay.  Note that it
      is possible to purge the entire cache, or to purge one URL at a
      time.  It is not possible to purge by regular expression or
      wildcard.  The URL purging system works by remembering which
      URLs are purged and validating each URL coming out of cache
      against them.  There is a limitation to the number of distinct
      URLs that can be purged.  When that limit is exceeded,
      everything in the cache older than the oldest remaining purge
      request will be dropped.  The limitation is high enough that
      it's not expected to be exceeded often, but is not currently
      changeable.
    </p>
    <h3 id="flush_cache_limitations">Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      The following limitations apply to both method the legacy and new methods
      of cache purging.
    </p>
    <p class="caution">
      <strong>Caution:</strong> In a multi-server system, you must run
      these commands on every server.  All the cache data from
      VirtualHosts using that cache directory will be flushed.  This
      is true even when using memcached: the cache flush information
      is kept locally on each machine running PageSpeed, not in the
      cache itself.  This is because of the L1 caches that run locally
      on each machine, and because memcached does not guarantee
      persistance.
    </p>
    <p class="caution">
      <strong>Caution:</strong> Flushing or purging the cache does not
      delete the old files from the directory, the memcached server,
      or PageSpeed's in-memory cache, but it tells PageSpeed to
      ignore those files.
    </p>

    <p class="note">Note: After flushing or purging the cache, the
      stale files will eventually be replaced with fresh copies or
      removed by the normal file cache cleaning process
      (see <code>FileCacheCleanIntervalMs</code> above).
    </p>

    <p>You can change the polling interval and name of the cache-flush
      file in the configuration file.  If you set the polling interval to 0, the
      cache flushing feature will be disabled.  If you specify the cache flush
      filename as a relative path, PageSpeed will look for that file in
      the <code>FileCachePath</code> directory.  If you use an absolute path,
      then the caches associated with multiple virtual hosts can be flushed all
      at once.

    <h2 id="downstream_caching">Downstream Caches</h2>

    PageSpeed is designed to work without any caches between it and the user,
    but it has experimental support for caching proxies.  It works with Varnish,
    Nginx's proxy_cache with the ngx_cache_purge module, and any other server
    that accepts purge requests over HTTP, allows fragmenting the cache based on
    UA regexps, and supports modifying caching headers based on the response's
    content type.  For details and sample configurations, please see the
    documentation on <a href="downstream-caching.html">configuring downstream
    caches</a>.


    <h2 id="shm_lock_manager">Configuring Use of Shared Memory for Locks</h2>

    <p>
      When fetching or rewriting resources PageSpeed uses locks to ensure that
      no redundant computation or fetching is done. This can use the file-system
      or shared memory. The system defaults to shared memory locks, but you can
      control which implementation is used with
      the <code>SharedMemoryLocks</code> option, passing it <code>on</code>
      or <code>off</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if you turn on shared memory locks when shared memory is not
      available, the system will fall back to file-system locks automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      On multi-server setups, locking being per-host will not adversely affect
      correctness but might result in multiple servers performing the
      same computation simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Virtual hosts that specify <code>SharedMemoryLocks on</code> with
      identical values of <code>FileCachePath</code> will share the same locking
      domain. Note that these must be identical strings, not just two strings
      representing the same directory. For example <code>/var/foo</code>
      and <code>/var/foo/</code> are different instances from a locking point of
      view.
    </p>

    <p>
      This setting's resource consumption is modest (300 kilobytes per instance
      on 64-bit systems) and it reduces file-system load.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cache-fragment">Configuring a Cache Fragment</h2>

    <p>
      By default every site has its own cache.  If you have multiple sites
      served from the same machine that reference common resources you can
      improve your cache performance and reduce CPU consumption by setting a
      shared cache fragment:
    </p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedCacheFragment some_token</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed CacheFragment some_token;</pre>
</dl>

    <p>
      You must set this to the same value on every site that
      shares a cache.  The fragment may consist of letters, numbers, underscores,
      and hyphens only.  The physical caching layer also has to be the same for
      the two sites: either you need a shared <code>FileCachePath</code> or you
      need to be using the same <code>memcached</code> server.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: you don't have to do this for simple cases
      like <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>images.example.com</code>.
      The default cache fragment is the minimal private suffix, in this
      case <code>example.com</code>, and is determined from
      the <a href="http://publicsuffix.org/">public suffix list</a>.  If you
      have <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>images.example.org</code>,
      however, then they will not share a common minimal private suffix and you
      should set the <code>CacheFragment</code> for better performance.
    </p>

    <h2 id="native-fetcher">Native URL fetcher</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: Nginx-only</strong></p>

    <p>
    Often PageSpeed needs to request URLs referenced from other files in order
    to optimize them. To do this it uses a fetcher. By default ngx_pagespeed
    uses the same fetcher mod_pagespeed does,
    <a href="http://serf.apache.org/">serf</a>, but it also has an
    experimental fetcher that avoids the need for a separate thread by using
    native Nginx events. In initial testing this fetcher is about 10% faster. To
    use it, put in your <code>http</code> block:
    </p>

    <pre>
pagespeed UseNativeFetcher on;
resolver 8.8.8.8;</pre>

    <p>
    Your DNS resolver doesn't have to
    be <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/">8.8.8.8</a>;
    any domain name service your server has access to will work. If you don't
    specify a DNS resolver, PageSpeed will still work but will be limited to
    fetching only from IP addresses.
    </p>

    <h2 id="native-fetcher-keep-alive">Persistent Connections with the Native
        URL Fetcher</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: Nginx-only</strong></p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.9.32.1</strong></p>

    <p>
      As of 1.9.32.1 the Native URL Fetcher
      supports <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">persistent
      HTTP connections</a>.  The fetcher will send the <code>Connection:
      Keep-Alive</code> header and if the server also sets that header on its
      response then the connection will be kept open for 60 seconds in case
      another fetch from the same server is needed. By default a connection will
      be reused no more than 100 times, but you can use
      <code>NativeFetcherMaxKeepaliveRequests</code> to change this limit.
      Keep-Alive support is on by default, and you can disable it by setting the
      limit to 0:
    </p>
    <pre>pagespeed NativeFetcherMaxKeepaliveRequests 0;</pre>

    <h2 id="url_fetcher_timeout">Setting the URL fetcher timeout</h2>

    <p>When PageSpeed attempts to rewrite a resource for the first
      time, it must fetch it via HTTP.  The default timeout for fetches is 5
      seconds.  A directive can be applied to change the timeout</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedFetcherTimeoutMs timeout_value_in_milliseconds</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed FetcherTimeoutMs timeout_value_in_milliseconds;</pre>
</dl>

    <h2 id="rewrite_deadline">Setting the rewrite deadline per flush window</h2>
    <p>When PageSpeed attempts to rewrite an uncached (or expired) resource
    it will wait for up to 10ms per flush window (by default) for it to finish
    and return the optimized resource if it's available.  If it has not
    completed within that time the original (unoptimized) resource is returned
    and the optimizer is moved to the background for future requests. The
    following directive can be applied to change the deadline. Increasing this
    value will increase page latency, but might reduce load time (for instance
    on a bandwidth-constrained link where it's worth waiting for image
    compression to complete). Note that a value less than zero will
    cause PageSpeed to wait indefinitely.</p>

<!--
    <h2 id="rewrite_cache_min_ttl"
        >Setting the minimum cache-lifetime for optimizing resources</h2>
    <p>When PageSpeed fetches a resource via HTTP or HTTPS, it uses
    the origin cache lifetime, based on the Expires or Cache-Control
    header, to determine how frequently it should check with the
    origin for updates.  If the time-to-live is very quick, then
    optimization might be pointless and PageSpeed will skip it.  The
    threshold is zero by default, meaning even 1-second resources will
    be optimized.  To set the threshold, use the configuration file
    setting:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedMinResourceCacheTimeToRewriteMs minimum_cache_ttl_in_milliseconds</pre>

-->

    <h2 id="implicit_cache_ttl"
        >Setting the implicit cache-lifetime for resources</h2>
    <p>When PageSpeed fetches a resource via HTTP or HTTPS, it
    examines the Expires and Cache-Control headers to determine how
    frequently it should update its cache.  When these headers don't
    specify a timeout, a default timeout of 5 minutes is used.  To
    override this, specify:</p>
<dl>

</dl>

    <h2 id="fetch_with_gzip">Fetching Resources using Gzip</h2>

    <p>This option causes PageSpeed to add <code>Accept-Encoding:gzip</code> to
      requests for resources.  If the server responding to the request
      handles this option (e.g. via mod_deflate), this results in reduced
      bytes transferred over the network.</p>

    <p>By default, PageSpeed attempts to fetch resources without specifying
      an<code>Accept-Encoding</code> header.  This means the resources will be
      sent uncompressed.  These requests are often within the LAN, so network
      bandwidth to transfer the resources may not be a consideration.</p>

    <p>If network bandwidth is a consideration, then PageSpeed can be
     configured to fetch resources using gzip.  This will lower the network
     transfer bandwidth considerably, but may increase the CPU usage depending
     on server configuration.  The primary concern is the time spent by the
     origin server compressing the resource, rather than the time spent by
     PageSpeed inflating it.</p>

    </p>

    <h2 id="tune_thread">Tuning Threading</h2>
    <p>
      PageSpeed uses threads so that resource optimization work does not delay
      request serving. There are two kinds of threads in use: <em>rewrite</em>
      threads deal with very short-lived bookkeeping tasks that are generally
      latency-sensitive, while <em>expensive rewrite</em> threads deal with more
      computationally expensive tasks that are not in latency-sensitive
      paths. By default, if you use a single-threaded MPM (such
      as <code>prefork</code>) one thread of each kind will be used per an
      Apache process. With a threaded MPM (such as <code>worker</code>,
      and <code>event</code>) up to 4 threads of each kind will be used.  You
      can, however, tune the thread count per process if necessary via
      the <code>NumRewriteThreads</code>
      and <code>NumExpensiveRewriteThreads</code> options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this is a global setting, and cannot be done in a per virtual
      host manner.
    </p>

    <h2 id="image_rewrite_max">Limiting the number of concurrent image
    optimizations</h2>
    <p>
      When optimizing images, PageSpeed can use significant CPU resources.  As
      the results of the image optimization are cached, this is not ordinarily a
      concern once the cache is warm.  But when PageSpeed is first installed, or
      when a corpus of new images is added to the server, PageSpeed needs to
      avoid having each process consume maximum CPU.  To accomplish this,
      PageSpeed keeps a server-wide counter of active image optimizations.  It
      avoids running more than <code>ImageMaxRewritesAtOnce</code> image
      optimizations in parallel across all processes.  The default value is 8.
      Override this in the configuration file to change this maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
      This directive can <strong>not</strong> be used
      in <a href="configuration#htaccess">location-specific configuration
      sections</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="max_parse_bytes">Limiting the size of HTML parsed</h2>
    <p>
      When parsing and rewriting large HTML pages, PageSpeed can use
      significant memory. This option limits the size of an HTML page that is
      parsed. Once the size of the HTML exceeds <code>MaxHtmlParseBytes</code>,
      further parsing is disabled, and a script is inserted that redirects the
      user to the <code>?ModPagespeed=off</code> version of the page.  The
      default value is 0, indicating that there is no limit. Override this in
      the configuration file to change this maximum.
    </p>

  <h2 id="ipro">In-Place Resource Optimization</h2>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note: Enabled by default as of 1.9.32.1</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Normally PageSpeed rewrites a resource such as an image by finding
    its URL on your page, fetching and optimizing the data in the background,
    and then replacing that URL by an optimized pagespeed URL. But what about
    resources that are loaded by JavaScript code? And what about links to your
    images from pages outside your domain? In-Place Resource Optimization (IPRO)
    will optimize the content of a resource that’s requested using the original
    (non-pagespeed) URL, ensuring you are serving optimized content even when
    that content isn’t explicitly linked in your html. This should be especially
    helpful for sites with slide shows that use JavaScript to load images in the
    background; those images can now be optimized by PageSpeed by adding
    this command to your configuration file:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedInPlaceResourceOptimization on</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed InPlaceResourceOptimization on;</pre>
</dl>
  <p>
    Some sites employ JavaScript that is sensitive to the original resource URL
    syntax and won't work with PageSpeed's altered resource URLs. You can
    choose to
    <a href="config_filters#preserveurls">preserve the URLs</a> of your
    resources; these will still be rewritten by IPRO, but they won't be replaced
    by a pagespeed URL. This is especially useful as an &quot;optimization is on
    by default&quot; setting for hosting providers and optimizing forward
    proxies – cases where site-specific settings to blacklist URLs are
    impractical.
  </p>
    <h3 id="s-maxage">Setting s-maxage on unoptimized resources</h3>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.12.34.1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When there is a caching proxy between PageSpeed and the user, resources
      that haven't been optimized yet shouldn't be stored in the proxy cache for
      the full cache lifetime because this will prevent PageSpeed from
      optimizing them.  As of 1.12.34.1, PageSpeed marks unoptimized resources
      with <span style="white-space:nowrap"><code>Cache-Control:
      s-maxage=10</code></span>, telling shared caches that they should only
      hold the unoptimized resource for ten seconds.  Browsers will ignore
      the <code>s-maxage</code> and will hold the resource for whatever cache
      lifetime you had originally set.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>s-maxage</code> value is configurable:
      <dl>
        <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
           >ModPagespeedInPlaceSMaxAgeSec 10</pre>
        <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
           >pagespeed InPlaceSMaxAgeSec 10;</pre>
      </dl>
      To restore the earlier behavior and not insert <code>s-maxage</code>, set
      <code>InPlaceSMaxAgeSec</code> to -1.
    </p>
    <h3 id="in_place_optimize_for_browser">Doing browser-specific in-place optimization</h3>
    <p>PageSpeed has a number of optimizations that are browser-specific.  For
    example, <a href="reference-image-optimize#convert_jpeg_to_webp">WebP
    conversion</a> is performed only for browsers that can display WebP images.
    Ordinarily PageSpeed accomplishes this by serving different rewritten URLs
    to different browsers depending upon their capabilities.  For resources that
    are rewritten in place, this isn't possible; instead, appropriate headers
    (such as Vary: Accept and Vary: User-Agent) are added to rewritten resources
    as necessary.  Enable these browser-specific optimizations as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedEnableFilters in_place_optimize_for_browser</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed EnableFilters in_place_optimize_for_browser;</pre>
</dl>
    <p>By default, when <code>in_place_optimize_for_browser</code> is enabled,
    appropriate <code>Vary:</code> headers are added to resources that are
    subject to browser-specific optimization.  CSS files are served with
    a <code>Vary: User-Agent</code> header.  Photographic images that are
    candidates for WebP conversion are served with <code>Vary: Accept</code> to
    browsers that include <code>Accept: image/webp</code> in their headers.
    Note that while the most recent versions of browsers that display WebP
    images include this header in image requests, older WebP-capable browsers do
    not &mdash; as a result, a slightly smaller subset of browsers will receive
    WebP images than would be the case if the URLs were rewritten.</p>

    <p>Internet Explorer has difficulty caching resources
    with <code>Vary:</code> headers (they are either not cached or require
    revalidation on every resource access).  As a result, browser-specific
    in-place resources are instead marked <code>Cache-Control: private</code>
    when served to all versions of Internet Explorer.</p>

    <p class="caution">
      <strong>Caution for users of downstream caches such as
    Varnish:</strong>  Consult the <a href="downstream-caching">documentation on
    configuring downstream caches</a> to correctly fragment cache keys based on
    user agent characteristics; this fragmentation should work equally well
    for <code>in_place_optimize_for_browser</code>.  The <code>Cache-Control:
    private</code> header sent to Internet Explorer will cause cache entries to
    be flushed unconditionally.  This behavior should be disabled as
    follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedPrivateNotVaryForIE off</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"

</dl>

    <h3 id="ipro_deadline">Setting the inplace resource rewrite deadline</h2>
    <p>When InPlaceResourceOptimization is enabled, PageSpeed uses a
    default deadline of 10ms the when optimizing the resource.  If the
    optimization cannot be completed in 10ms, then the original
    resource is served to the client, while the optimization continues
    in the background.  Once cached, the optimized resource will be
    served for further requests.  Note that a value less than
    zero will cause PageSpeed to wait indefinitely.</p>
    <p>Also note that in-place-optimized resources generally take at
    least two refreshes to optimize regardless of the deadline, due to
    the current architecture of the server modules.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"

    Furthermore, in-place resource optimization allows more expansive rewriting
    with <a href="#uncacheable_optimization">optimize uncacheable resources</a>.
  </p>
-->
  <h3>Considerations</h3>
  <p>Resources optimized by in-place resource optimization are optimized
    differently from resources found in HTML, JS, and CSS. First, rewritten
    pagespeed URLs contain a content hash that enables the optimized data to be
    cached for a year by browser and proxy caches; in-place resources are not
    cache extended. Second, in-place resources can't be optimized specially for
    the context in which they occur on the page: images can't be resized to the
    size they appear on the page, and multiple resources on a page can’t be
    combined together. Finally, in-place resources that are eligible for
    browser-specific optimizations (such as conversion to the WebP image format)
    will be served with the <code>Vary: User-Agent</code> caching header,
    reducing caching at intermediate proxies.</p>
  <h3>Risks</h3>
  <p>In-place resource optimization will add a new cache entry for every
    unique URL requested. It will also copy each request into memory once. If
    you have a large site with many uncacheable resources, this could quickly
    fill up your cache or cause a lot of expensive string copies.</p>
  <p>In-place optimization will also add a small delay to every server
    response, this should not be large and we have not been able to measure any
    noticeable slow-down, but if most of your resources are uncacheable, you may
    wish to avoid this cost.</p>

    <!--
    <h2 id="uncacheable_optimization">Optimizing Uncacheable Resources</h2>
    <p>
      By default PageSpeed does not optimize resources that are uncacheable
      or if Cache-Control header is set to private or no-store.
      For sites where it's more important to optimize for bandwidth than
      latency, it is desirable to optimize uncacheable resources.
      By using the combination of flags shown below it is possible to optimize
      uncacheable resources without storing them in the cache. This works only
      when <a href="#ipro">in-place resource optimization</a> is enabled.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Note, that this setting can be very CPU intensive for the sites that have
      a lot of private/uncacheable resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flags which are required to be set are:
    </p>

<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedRewriteUncacheableResources on
ModPagespeedInPlaceWaitForOptimized on
ModPagespeedInPlaceResourceOptimization on</pre>

    <p>
      The <code>RewriteUncacheableResources</code> directive
      can <strong>not</strong> be used
      in <a href="configuration#htaccess">location-specific configuration
      sections</a>.
    </p>
    -->

    <h2 id="rate_limit_background_fetches">Rate Limit Background Fetches</h2>
    <p>
       To avoid overloading the origin server, PageSpeed will limit the number
       of background fetches it makes on a per-domain basis.  As PageSpeed makes
       fetches it keeps a count of how many ongoing fetches there are for each
       domain, and if there are too many then additional fetches will only be
       allowed through if they're for user-facing requests.  Other fetches
       (background fetches) will be queued up for completion later.  If the
       queue gets too large, PageSpeed will give up on those background
       optimizations, leaving them to be reinitiated in response to a later
       request.  This feature can be disabled by
       setting <code>RateLimitBackgroundFetches</code> to <code>off</code>:
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedRateLimitBackgroundFetches off</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed RateLimitBackgroundFetches off;</pre>
</dl>

       This feature depends on <a href="admin#statistics">shared memory
       statistics</a>, which are also enabled by default.

    <h2 id="gzip_cache">Configuring HTTPCache Compression for PageSpeed</h2>
    <p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: HTTPCache Compression is a new feature as of
      1.10.33.0</strong></p>
      In order to rewrite resources, PageSpeed must cache them server-side.
      Until 1.10.33.0, these resources had been stored uncompressed.
      To reduce disk usage, decrease server latency, support higher compression
      levels, and increase server throughput, the HTTPCache can automatically
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer">gzip</a>
      compressable resources as they are stored in the cache.
      To configure cache compression, set <code>HttpCacheCompressionLevel</code>
      to values between <code>-1</code> and <code>9</code>, with <code>0</code>
      being off, <code>-1</code> being gzip's default compression, and
      <code>9</code> being maximum compression. The default value is 9, maximum
      compression.
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedHttpCacheCompressionLevel 9</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"

    <h2 id="nginx_script_variables">Scripting ngx_pagespeed</h2>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.9.32.1</strong></p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: Extended in 1.12.34.1</strong></p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note: Nginx-only</strong></p>

    <p>
      PageSpeed supports
      Nginx's <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html">script
      variables</a> in some directives.  You can use this to
      adjust these settings on a per-request basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Script support must be enabled at the top level.  To turn it on for a
      subset of directives, which is the only method supported in 1.11 and
      earlier, set:
<pre class="prettyprint">
http {
  pagespeed ProcessScriptVariables on;
  ...
}</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This allows scripts in the following directives:
    </p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>Setting<th>Script Support Added
        <tr><td><a href="domains#LoadFromFileScriptVariables"
                   >LoadFromFile*</a>
            <td>1.9.32.1</td>
        <tr><td><a href="downstream-caching#script-variables"
                   >DownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix</a>
            <td>1.10.33.0
        <tr><td><a href="downstream-caching#script-variables"
                   >DownstreamCachePurgeMethod</a>
            <td>1.10.33.0
        <tr><td><a href="downstream-caching#script-variables"
                   >DownstreamCacheRewrittenPercentageThreshold</a>
            <td>1.10.33.0
        <tr><td><a href="https_support#h2_configuration_nginx"
                   >EnableFilters</a>
            <td>1.10.33.0
        <tr><td><a href="https_support#h2_configuration_nginx"
                   >DisableFilters</a>
            <td>1.10.33.0
        <tr><td><a href="https_support#h2_configuration_nginx"
                   >ShardDomain</a>
            <td>1.10.33.0
      </table>

    <p>
      In version 1.12.34.1 and later, you may instead set:
      <pre class="prettyprint">
http {
  pagespeed ProcessScriptVariables all;
  ...
}</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This will allow scripts in all directives, not just the seven specified
      above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because Nginx uses the <code>$</code>-sign to indicate script variables,
      when you turn on <code>ProcessScriptVariables</code> you need to make a
      small change to any script-supporting commands that are
      using <code>$</code>.  For example, if you had:
<pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFileRuleMatch Disallow \.ssp.css$;</pre>
      Then you would need to replace <code>$</code>
      with <code>$ps_dollar</code>:
<pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed LoadFromFileRuleMatch Disallow \.ssp.css$ps_dollar;</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a server that you don't want the scripted configuration to
      apply, specify <code>ClearInheritedScripts</code>.  For example:
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
http {
  pagespeed ProcessScriptVariables on;
  pagespeed LoadFromFile "http://$host/static" "$document_root/static";
  ...
  server {
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/ec;

    # PageSpeed will load example.com/static/foo from /var/www/ec/static/foo
    # directly, without going through the rest of nginx.
  }
  server {
    server_name example.org;
    root /var/www/eo;

    pagespeed ClearInheritedScripts;

    # This server block won't see that LoadFromFile config at all, so PageSpeed
    # will load example.org/static/foo by asking nginx for /static/foo over
    # http.
  }
}</pre>
