// A RewriteContext is all the contextual information required to
// perform one or more Rewrites.  Member data in the ResourceContext
// helps us track the collection of data to rewrite, via async
// cache-lookup or async fetching.  It also tracks what to do with the
// rewritten data when the rewrite completes (e.g. rewrite the URL in
// HTML or serve the requested data).
//
// RewriteContext is subclassed to control the transformation (e.g.
// minify js, compress images, etc).
//
// A new RewriteContext is created on behalf of an HTML or CSS
// rewrite, or on behalf of a resource-fetch.  A single filter may
// have multiple outstanding RewriteContexts associated with it.
// In the case of combining filters, a single RewriteContext may
// result in multiple rewritten resources that are partitioned based
// on data semantics.  Most filters will just work on one resource,
// and those can inherit from SingleRewriteContext which is simpler
// to implement.
//
// TODO(jmarantz): add support for controlling TTL on failures.
//
// RewriteContext utilizes two threads (via QueuedWorkerPool::Sequence)
// to do most of its work. The "high priority" thread is used to run the
// dataflow graph: queue up fetches and cache requests, partition inputs,
// render results, etc. The actual Rewrite() methods, however, are invoked
// in the "low priority" thread and can be canceled during extreme load
// or shutdown.
//
// Top-level RewriteContexts are initialized from the HTML
// thread.  In particular, from this thread they can be constructed,
// and AddSlot() and Initiate() can be called.  Once Initiate is
// called, the RewriteContext runs purely in its two threads, until
// it completes.  At that time it calls
// RewriteDriver::RewriteComplete.  Once complete, the RewriteDriver
// can call RewriteContext::Propagate() and finally delete the object.
//
// RewriteContexts can also be nested, in which case they are constructed,
// slotted, and Initated all within the rewrite threads.  However, they
// are Propagated and destructed by their parent, which is initiated by the
// RewriteDriver.
