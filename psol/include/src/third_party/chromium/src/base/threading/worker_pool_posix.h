// The thread pool used in the POSIX implementation of WorkerPool dynamically
// adds threads as necessary to handle all tasks.  It keeps old threads around
// for a period of time to allow them to be reused.  After this waiting period,
// the threads exit.  This thread pool uses non-joinable threads, therefore
// worker threads are not joined during process shutdown.  This means that
// potentially long running tasks (such as DNS lookup) do not block process
// shutdown, but also means that process shutdown may "leak" objects.  Note that
// although PosixDynamicThreadPool spawns the worker threads and manages the
// task queue, it does not own the worker threads.  The worker threads ask the
// PosixDynamicThreadPool for work and eventually clean themselves up.  The
// worker threads all maintain scoped_refptrs to the PosixDynamicThreadPool
// instance, which prevents PosixDynamicThreadPool from disappearing before all
// worker threads exit.  The owner of PosixDynamicThreadPool should likewise
// maintain a scoped_refptr to the PosixDynamicThreadPool instance.
//
// NOTE: The classes defined in this file are only meant for use by the POSIX
// implementation of WorkerPool.  No one else should be using these classes.
// These symbols are exported in a header purely for testing purposes.
