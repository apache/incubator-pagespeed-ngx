// SdchFilter applies open_vcdiff content decoding to a datastream.
// This decoding uses a pre-cached dictionary of text fragments to decode
// (expand) the stream back to its original contents.
//
// This SdchFilter internally uses open_vcdiff/vcdec library to do decoding.
//
// SdchFilter is also a subclass of Filter. See the latter's header file
// filter.h for sample usage.
