 *
 * Filters operate using a "chaining" mechanism. The filters are chained
 * together into a sequence. When output is generated, it is passed through
 * each of the filters on this chain, until it reaches the end (or "bottom")
 * and is placed onto the network.
 *
 * The top of the chain, the code generating the output, is typically called
 * a "content generator." The content generator's output is fed into the
 * filter chain using the standard Apache output mechanisms: ap_rputs(),
 * ap_rprintf(), ap_rwrite(), etc.
 *
 * Each filter is defined by a callback. This callback takes the output from
 * the previous filter (or the content generator if there is no previous
 * filter), operates on it, and passes the result to the next filter in the
 * chain. This pass-off is performed using the ap_fc_* functions, such as
 * ap_fc_puts(), ap_fc_printf(), ap_fc_write(), etc.
 *
 * When content generation is complete, the system will pass an "end of
 * stream" marker into the filter chain. The filters will use this to flush
 * out any internal state and to detect incomplete syntax (for example, an
 * unterminated SSI directive).
 *

/**
 * @name Filter callbacks
 *
 * This function type is used for filter callbacks. It will be passed a
 * pointer to "this" filter, and a "bucket brigade" containing the content
 * to be filtered.
 *
 * In filter->ctx, the callback will find its context. This context is
 * provided here, so that a filter may be installed multiple times, each
 * receiving its own per-install context pointer.
 *
 * Callbacks are associated with a filter definition, which is specified
 * by name. See ap_register_input_filter() and ap_register_output_filter()
 * for setting the association between a name for a filter and its
 * associated callback (and other information).
 *
 * If the initialization function argument passed to the registration
 * functions is non-NULL, it will be called iff the filter is in the input
 * or output filter chains and before any data is generated to allow the
 * filter to prepare for processing.
 *
 * The bucket brigade always belongs to the caller, but the filter
 * is free to use the buckets within it as it sees fit. Normally,
 * the brigade will be returned empty. Buckets *may not* be retained
 * between successive calls to the filter unless they have been
 * "set aside" with a call apr_bucket_setaside. Typically this will
 * be done with ap_save_brigade(). Buckets removed from the brigade
 * become the responsibility of the filter, which must arrange for
 * them to be deleted, either by doing so directly or by inserting
 * them in a brigade which will subsequently be destroyed.
 *
 * For the input and output filters, the return value of a filter should be
 * an APR status value.  For the init function, the return value should
 * be an HTTP error code or OK if it was successful.
