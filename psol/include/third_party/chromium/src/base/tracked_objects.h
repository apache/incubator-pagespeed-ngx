// TrackedObjects provides a database of stats about objects (generally Tasks)
// that are tracked.  Tracking means their birth, death, duration, birth thread,
// death thread, and birth place are recorded.  This data is carefully spread
// across a series of objects so that the counts and times can be rapidly
// updated without (usually) having to lock the data, and hence there is usually
// very little contention caused by the tracking.  The data can be viewed via
// the about:profiler URL, with a variety of sorting and filtering choices.
//
// These classes serve as the basis of a profiler of sorts for the Tasks system.
// As a result, design decisions were made to maximize speed, by minimizing
// recurring allocation/deallocation, lock contention and data copying.  In the
// "stable" state, which is reached relatively quickly, there is no separate
// marginal allocation cost associated with construction or destruction of
// tracked objects, no locks are generally employed, and probably the largest
// computational cost is associated with obtaining start and stop times for
// instances as they are created and destroyed.
//
// The following describes the lifecycle of tracking an instance.
//
// First off, when the instance is created, the FROM_HERE macro is expanded
// to specify the birth place (file, line, function) where the instance was
// created.  That data is used to create a transient Location instance
// encapsulating the above triple of information.  The strings (like __FILE__)
// are passed around by reference, with the assumption that they are static, and
// will never go away.  This ensures that the strings can be dealt with as atoms
// with great efficiency (i.e., copying of strings is never needed, and
// comparisons for equality can be based on pointer comparisons).
//
// Next, a Births instance is created for use ONLY on the thread where this
// instance was created.  That Births instance records (in a base class
// BirthOnThread) references to the static data provided in a Location instance,
// as well as a pointer specifying the thread on which the birth takes place.
// Hence there is at most one Births instance for each Location on each thread.
// The derived Births class contains slots for recording statistics about all
// instances born at the same location.  Statistics currently include only the
// count of instances constructed.
//
// Since the base class BirthOnThread contains only constant data, it can be
// freely accessed by any thread at any time (i.e., only the statistic needs to
// be handled carefully, and stats are updated exclusively on the birth thread).
//
// For Tasks, having now either constructed or found the Births instance
// described above, a pointer to the Births instance is then recorded into the
// PendingTask structure in MessageLoop.  This fact alone is very useful in
// debugging, when there is a question of where an instance came from.  In
// addition, the birth time is also recorded and used to later evaluate the
// lifetime duration of the whole Task.  As a result of the above embedding, we
// can find out a Task's location of birth, and thread of birth, without using
// any locks, as all that data is constant across the life of the process.
//
// The above work *could* also be done for any other object as well by calling
// TallyABirthIfActive() and TallyRunOnNamedThreadIfTracking() as appropriate.
//
// The amount of memory used in the above data structures depends on how many
// threads there are, and how many Locations of construction there are.
// Fortunately, we don't use memory that is the product of those two counts, but
// rather we only need one Births instance for each thread that constructs an
// instance at a Location. In many cases, instances are only created on one
// thread, so the memory utilization is actually fairly restrained.
//
// Lastly, when an instance is deleted, the final tallies of statistics are
// carefully accumulated.  That tallying writes into slots (members) in a
// collection of DeathData instances.  For each birth place Location that is
// destroyed on a thread, there is a DeathData instance to record the additional
// death count, as well as accumulate the run-time and queue-time durations for
// the instance as it is destroyed (dies).  By maintaining a single place to
// aggregate this running sum *only* for the given thread, we avoid the need to
// lock such DeathData instances. (i.e., these accumulated stats in a DeathData
// instance are exclusively updated by the singular owning thread).
//
// With the above lifecycle description complete, the major remaining detail is
// explaining how each thread maintains a list of DeathData instances, and of
// Births instances, and is able to avoid additional (redundant/unnecessary)
// allocations.
//
// Each thread maintains a list of data items specific to that thread in a
// ThreadData instance (for that specific thread only).  The two critical items
// are lists of DeathData and Births instances.  These lists are maintained in
// STL maps, which are indexed by Location. As noted earlier, we can compare
// locations very efficiently as we consider the underlying data (file,
// function, line) to be atoms, and hence pointer comparison is used rather than
// (slow) string comparisons.
//
// To provide a mechanism for iterating over all "known threads," which means
// threads that have recorded a birth or a death, we create a singly linked list
// of ThreadData instances. Each such instance maintains a pointer to the next
// one.  A static member of ThreadData provides a pointer to the first item on
// this global list, and access via that all_thread_data_list_head_ item
// requires the use of the list_lock_.
// When new ThreadData instances is added to the global list, it is pre-pended,
// which ensures that any prior acquisition of the list is valid (i.e., the
// holder can iterate over it without fear of it changing, or the necessity of
// using an additional lock.  Iterations are actually pretty rare (used
// primarilly for cleanup, or snapshotting data for display), so this lock has
// very little global performance impact.
//
// The above description tries to define the high performance (run time)
// portions of these classes.  After gathering statistics, calls instigated
// by visiting about:profiler will assemble and aggregate data for display.  The
// following data structures are used for producing such displays.  They are
// not performance critical, and their only major constraint is that they should
// be able to run concurrently with ongoing augmentation of the birth and death
// data.
//
// This header also exports collection of classes that provide "snapshotted"
// representations of the core tracked_objects:: classes.  These snapshotted
// representations are designed for safe transmission of the tracked_objects::
// data across process boundaries.  Each consists of:
// (1) a default constructor, to support the IPC serialization macros,
// (2) a constructor that extracts data from the type being snapshotted, and
// (3) the snapshotted data.
//
// For a given birth location, information about births is spread across data
// structures that are asynchronously changing on various threads.  For
// serialization and display purposes, we need to construct TaskSnapshot
// instances for each combination of birth thread, death thread, and location,
// along with the count of such lifetimes.  We gather such data into a
// TaskSnapshot instances, so that such instances can be sorted and
// aggregated (and remain frozen during our processing).
//
// The ProcessDataSnapshot struct is a serialized representation of the list
// of ThreadData objects for a process.  It holds a set of TaskSnapshots
// and tracks parent/child relationships for the executed tasks.  The statistics
// in a snapshot are gathered asynhcronously relative to their ongoing updates.
// It is possible, though highly unlikely, that stats could be incorrectly
// recorded by this process (all data is held in 32 bit ints, but we are not
// atomically collecting all data, so we could have count that does not, for
// example, match with the number of durations we accumulated).  The advantage
// to having fast (non-atomic) updates of the data outweighs the minimal risk of
// a singular corrupt statistic snapshot (only the snapshot could be corrupt,
// not the underlying and ongoing statistic).  In constrast, pointer data that
// is accessed during snapshotting is completely invariant, and hence is
// perfectly acquired (i.e., no potential corruption, and no risk of a bad
// memory reference).
//
// TODO(jar): We can implement a Snapshot system that *tries* to grab the
// snapshots on the source threads *when* they have MessageLoops available
// (worker threads don't have message loops generally, and hence gathering from
// them will continue to be asynchronous).  We had an implementation of this in
// the past, but the difficulty is dealing with message loops being terminated.
// We can *try* to spam the available threads via some message loop proxy to
// achieve this feat, and it *might* be valuable when we are colecting data for
// upload via UMA (where correctness of data may be more significant than for a
// single screen of about:profiler).
//
// TODO(jar): We should support (optionally) the recording of parent-child
// relationships for tasks.  This should be done by detecting what tasks are
// Born during the running of a parent task.  The resulting data can be used by
// a smarter profiler to aggregate the cost of a series of child tasks into
// the ancestor task.  It can also be used to illuminate what child or parent is
// related to each task.
//
// TODO(jar): We need to store DataCollections, and provide facilities for
// taking the difference between two gathered DataCollections.  For now, we're
// just adding a hack that Reset()s to zero all counts and stats.  This is also
// done in a slighly thread-unsafe fashion, as the resetting is done
// asynchronously relative to ongoing updates (but all data is 32 bit in size).
// For basic profiling, this will work "most of the time," and should be
// sufficient... but storing away DataCollections is the "right way" to do this.
// We'll accomplish this via JavaScript storage of snapshots, and then we'll
// remove the Reset() methods.  We may also need a short-term-max value in
// DeathData that is reset (as synchronously as possible) during each snapshot.
// This will facilitate displaying a max value for each snapshot period.
