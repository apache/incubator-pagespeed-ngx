 * or install_network_transport hook. This hook should close the connection
 * if it encounters a fatal error condition.
 *
 * @param p The pool from which to allocate the connection record
 * @param server The server record to create the connection too.
 * @param csd The socket that has been accepted
 * @param conn_id A unique identifier for this connection.  The ID only
 *                needs to be unique at that time, not forever.
 * @param sbh A handle to scoreboard information for this connection.
 * @param alloc The bucket allocator to use for all bucket/brigade creations
 * @return An allocated connection record or NULL.
