/*
 * request.c is the code which handles the main line of request
 * processing, once a request has been read in (finding the right per-
 * directory configuration, building it if necessary, and calling all
 * the module dispatch functions in the right order).
 *
 * The pieces here which are public to the modules, allow them to learn
 * how the server would handle some other file or URI, or perhaps even
 * direct the server to serve that other file instead of the one the
 * client requested directly.
 *
 * There are two ways to do that.  The first is the sub_request mechanism,
 * which handles looking up files and URIs as adjuncts to some other
 * request (e.g., directory entries for multiviews and directory listings);
 * the lookup functions stop short of actually running the request, but
 * (e.g., for includes), a module may call for the request to be run
 * by calling run_sub_req.  The space allocated to create sub_reqs can be
 * reclaimed by calling destroy_sub_req --- be sure to copy anything you care
 * about which was allocated in its apr_pool_t elsewhere before doing this.
