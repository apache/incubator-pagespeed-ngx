// This forms the basis of a wildcard selection mechanism, allowing
// a user to issue a sequence of commands like:
//
//   1. allow *.cc
//   2. allow *.h
//   3. disallow a*.h
//   4. allow ab*.h
//   5. disallow c*.cc
//
// This sequence would yield the following results:
//   Match("x.cc") --> true  due to rule #1
//   Match("c.cc") --> false due to rule #5 which overrides rule #1
//   Match("y.h")  --> true  due to rule #2
//   Match("a.h")  --> false due to rule #3 which overrides rule #2
//   Match("ab.h") --> true  due to rule #4 which overrides rule #3
// So order matters.
//
// Note that concurrent calls to Match(...) are permitted, but modifications
// must not occur concurrently (as you would expect).

/* A note on the algorithm used here:

Wildcard matching uses an O(nm) string search algorithm, where m is pattern
length and n is string length (basically we search forward for first char in the
next pattern chunk, then attempt a match at that position).  This is not the
asymptotically efficient O(n+m) as it ignores the effects of prefixes and
repeated substrings, but the wildcards that occur in PageSpeed tend to contain
chunks of diverse literals and so it's good enough in practice.

WildcardGroup simply iterates through wildcards in the group, attempting to
match against each one in turn.

In FastWildcardGroup we attempt a Rabin-Karp string match for a fixed-size
substring of each of the wildcards.  We choose the largest possible substring
size for a given group (for a single wildcard pattern, this will be the length
of the longest literal in the pattern; for the group, it is the minimum such
length).  Note that in the worst case this is a single character (we treat
all-wildcard patterns specially).  We track the insertion index of the
latest-inserted matched pattern (so the first pattern in the set has index 0,
and initially our insertion index is -1).  As in Rabin-Karp we traverse the
string using a rolling hash; when we encounter a hash match, we retrieve the
corresponding insertion index.  If it's larger than our current insertion index
(the pattern would override), we retrieve the pattern and attempt to match the
whole string against it.  If the match succeeds we update the insertion index.
Our return value is the corresponding "allow" status.

We actually optimize this a little in two ways: rather than remembering the
insertion index, we actually remember the insertion index just before the next
change in "allow" status (the effective index).  So for example, if we insert 10
"allow" patterns in a row and then a single "deny" pattern, matching against the
first "allow" pattern means that we will subsequently check only against the
"deny" pattern.  The second optimization builds on this: if the effective index
is the last pattern in the group (always true if the group is nothing but
"allow" or "deny" entries) then we can immediately return.

We use a simple vector of indexes to store the hash table, dealing with
collisions by linear probing.  Metadata (eg a cached hash) is stored with the
patterns.  We make the table size >= 2x the number of patterns so that chains
don't get long, and all failed probes terminate in an empty bucket.
