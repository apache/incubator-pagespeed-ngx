// Collects output from pagespeed and buffers it until nginx asks for it.
// Notifies nginx via pipe to call CollectAccumulatedWrites() on flush.
//
//  - nginx creates a base fetch and passes it to a new proxy fetch.
//  - The proxy fetch manages rewriting and thread complexity, and through
//    several chained steps passes rewritten html to HandleWrite().
//  - Written data is buffered.
//  - When Flush() is called the base fetch writes a byte to a pipe nginx is
//    watching so nginx knows to call CollectAccumulatedWrites() to pick up the
//    rewritten html.
//  - When Done() is called the base fetch closes the pipe, which tells nginx to
//    make a final call to CollectAccumulatedWrites().
//
// This class is referred two in two places: the proxy fetch and nginx's
// request.  It must stay alive until both are finished.  The proxy fetch will
// call Done() to indicate this; nginx will call Release().  Once both Done()
// and Release() have been called this class will delete itself.
