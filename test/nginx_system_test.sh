# Runs pagespeed's generic system test.  Will eventually run nginx-specific
# tests as well.
#
# Exits with status 0 if all tests pass.
# Exits with status 1 immediately if any test fails.
# Exits with status 2 if command line args are wrong.
#
# Usage:
#   Set up nginx to serve mod_pagespeed/src/install/ statically at the server
#   root, then run:
#     ./ngx_system_test.sh HOST:PORT
#   for example:
#     ./ngx_system_test.sh localhost:8050
#
